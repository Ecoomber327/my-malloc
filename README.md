# my-malloc
Implements my own version of malloc. Dynamically allocates memory on the heap depending on the functions called. Currently implements my own version of the following functions:

malloc - Dynamically allocates memory on the heap
calloc - Allocates memory but initializes all of its bits to 0.
realloc - Changes the size of a previously allocated chunk of memory to the new desired amount.

Also includes a Makefile which allows for easy compilation and testing. The various command line options were used for various stages of testing to ensure the methods run correctly.
